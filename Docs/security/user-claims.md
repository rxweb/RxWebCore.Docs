It is subjected by an issuer. In our case, the issuer is the application. It can also be a service, a role provider, an identity provider. An isuuer delivers claims by issuing security token.  

# Jwt token generation
The Jwt web token is generated with the help of the claims which are issued. It is generated using the WriteToken method of `IJwtTokenProvider` of RxWeb.Core.Security namespace. Based upon the claims passed the web token will be generated and based upon them the Web API will be accessed.
