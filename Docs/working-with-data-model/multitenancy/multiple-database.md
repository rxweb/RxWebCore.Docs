<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>MultiTenantId</th><th>HostUri</th><th>ConnectionName</th><th>ConnectionString</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>localhost:44395</td><td>Main</td><td>Your connection string</td></tr>
</table>

## Step 2 : 
Run cli command   

```js
rxwebcore --add-feature --multitenant
