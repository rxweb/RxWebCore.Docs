# Generate POCO Model

`POCO` means `Plain Old CLR Object`. POCO Entity is a class that doesn't depend on any framework-specific base class. These models act as a data carriers and has validation and any other business logic you want to implement. 

> POCO model must be publically accessible.

Database entities which can be generated as POCO models are:

<ul>
    <li>Tables</li>
    <li>Views</li>
    <li>Record View</li>
    <li>Lookup View</li>
</ul>

 you can create POCO models for all the required tables and views. For creating their POCO models in the application, open the `Package Manager Console` and run the following command:

```js
rxwebcore --models --main
```

This will generate POCO models for all the tables and views in the `DbEntities` folder inside the `Models` section of the project.

## Example

Here is an example of the generated model:

```
    [Table("Clients",Schema="dbo")]
    public partial class Client
    {
		#region ClientId Annotations

        [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
        [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Key]
		#endregion ClientId Annotations

        public int ClientId { get; set; }

		#region ClientName Annotations

        [MaxLength(10)]
		#endregion ClientName Annotations

        public string ClientName { get; set; }

		#region Candidates Annotations

        [InverseProperty("Client")]
		#endregion Candidates Annotations

        public virtual ICollection<Candidate> Candidates { get; set; }


        public Client()
        {
			Candidates = new HashSet<Candidate>();
        }
	}
```
